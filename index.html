                It reminded me of rain on the mountains and the feel of sun on the back of my neck, warming the goosebumps off my skin. It reminded me of seeing my brother’s smile and growing

                in the absence of things the days were hot and long and I'd come home from work pretty spent. 
                The gym was treating me well, progress was progress undeniable, but I couldn’t deny a void in so much 
                of what I lived and felt. In lack of strong vices or even the money to spend on such things I’d daydream while the sun was still out,
                riding bikes and walking trails aimlessly until dark, convinced I'd find an answer between the cedars and sycamores for <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">whatever the hell I was even looking for.</span>
                Nights I’d lie tiger-striped by the moonlight running through my window, 
                too much to consider to sleep.<br>Rain here and there to break up the monotony, summer games here and there to mark the passage of time.<br><br>
                Days passed, weeks passed, looking much the same. All I remember is I picked my head up after looking down for a long time, 
                the longest time, and <br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">you were there.

                the silhouette of her face opposite mine, the way she laughed eyes-closed and carefree. It was all right
                there at the front of my mind all day, a reminder of days unmuddied by doubt and fear. Moments when I 
                felt like part of a larger whole, connected to another at the heart, god how much do I miss that. Though
                it crumbled despite my best intentions, realistically I didn't see any other way. Love could exist and
                grow only in a world without borders, and any effort I made to wrangle it into some structured 
                understanding was misled. From somewhere inside my get-it-all-right tendencies was the need to make it 
                all align and fit properly, with defined edges and nothing overlapping.<br><br>
                
                Like I said, I still remember:
                her dorky shoes, the ones I made fun of, her eyebrows strong and razor sharp, the pierce of her gaze 
                cutting right through me, her sense of humor and the way it melted into mine, the way I felt around her,

                It must've been summer. Not a whole lot to do before bed those days, read and listen to some music, maybe write a bit of what was on my mind. 
                Things were quiet but in a good way, enough 
                excitement to keep me occupied and enough downtime to really soak in my surroundings. The trees were hypnotically green, 
                the air was cool at night and the sunsets never failed to impress, not once. I'd wake up early, earlier than I'd ever had 
                consistently and get my day off to a good start. Needless to say the weeks flew by. A turbulent time, blurry and colorful and 
                fuzzy around the edges.<br> I enjoyed much of it, and new immediately I'd grow to miss it in the future. Not fair how life does that
                to you.<br> <br>But where was I? Hard to say, hard to put a time and a place on a moment that had been with me all my life, that I'd lived
                a thousand iterations of in every interminable existence. That I'd dreamt, imagined, and reconsidered so many times, twirling it between 
                my fingers, that when it finally happened I couldn't fathom it to be real. <br> But it had to be. Got to be. I know because I woke up that
                day without that pit in my stomach, you know the one. 
                I must've been at a friends house, or I think I went out for a run on a cool day, or I woke up
                on the beach and there she was. Can't say. Maybe I was on a walk after dark, or wandering the forest trails I could find, or 
                doing something, anything, a million things of no consequence all wrapped up in my own misinterpretations of it all
                before she ever came around.

                I’d tie my boots tight, always stepping over the debris of some runaway dream, marks of it on the underside of those warm days of spring. 
                Though I couldn’t remember the contents of it I could remember it’s shape and the way it felt in my hands.
                Almost as if I could swim in it, a pool of deep green water that let me float weightless. Suspended on my back I’d look up and 
                watch the trees sway effortlessly overhead. Something promising and regal about them, something shared and honored. <br><br>
                Waking up felt like a lie, bone dry and monotone. The palm fronds no longer shrouding me from the sun; the sound of the 
                ripples no longer filling my ears. I’d sit grasping frayed ends of memory for why 
                I dreamt what I dreamt only to lose it. Nothing immediately clear enough to be recollected yet still sharp around the edges, enough 
                so that I’d slip and cut my fingers on it. However frustrating it might’ve been, I couldn’t help but smell the sweetness 
                it left behind when I’d wake. I’d dress and walk, carrying with me the shreds of misremembered moments, scraps that I 
                couldn’t glue together with enough glue or stitch together with enough thread: my sister’s thread she never used yet always 
                seemed to be in the wrong place. I’d find it on the couch, under the table, and on my clothes, the scraps of her that I carried with me too. </p>
